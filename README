This directory contains 'cpphs', a simplified re-implementation of cpp,
the C pre-processor, in Haskell.

TO BUILD
--------
Just use
    hmake cpphs [-package base]
or
    ghc --make cpphs
or
    runhugs cpphs


USAGE
-----
	cpphs  [ filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath ]+
               [ --nomacro ] [ --noline ]

You can give any number of filenames on the command-line.  The
results are catenated on standard output.

Options:
    -Dsym	define a symbol
    -Dsym=val	define a symbol with a specific value
    -Ipath	add a directory to the search path for #include's
    --nomacro	only process #ifdef's and #include's, do not expand macros
    --noline	remove #line droppings from the output

There are NO symbols defined by default.  (This could easily be
changed in the source code though.)  The search path is searched in
order of the -I options, except that the current directory is always
searched first.  Again, there is no default search path (and again,
this could easily be changed).


RATIONALE
---------
Why re-implement cpp?  Rightly or wrongly, the C pre-processor is 
widely used in Haskell source code.  It enables conditional compilation 
for different compilers, different versions of the same compiler, 
and different OS platforms.  It is also occasionally used for its
macro language, which can enable certain forms of platform-specific
detail-filling, such as the tedious boilerplate generation of instance
definitions and FFI declarations.  However, there are two problems with
cpp, aside from the obvious aesthetic ones:

 * For some Haskell systems, notably Hugs on Windows, a true cpp
   is not available by default.
 * Even for the other Haskell systems, the common cpp provided by
   the gcc 3.x series is changing subtly in ways that are 
   incompatible with Haskell's syntax.  There have always been 
   problems with, for instance, string gaps, and prime characters
   in identifiers.  These problems are only going to get worse.

So, it seemed right to attempt to provide an alternative to cpp, 
both more compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so 
that it can be distributed with compilers.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much feature-complete.
It has two modes:
  * conditional compilation only (--nomacro);
  * full macro-expansion (default).
In --nomacro mode, cpphs performs only conditional compilation actions,
namely #include's, #if's, and #ifdef's are processed according to
symbol definitions (both command-line and internal), but no symbol
replacement or parameterised macro expansion is performed.  In full
compatibility mode (the default), symbol replacements and macro
expansions are also processed.

Working Features:
    #ifdef	simple conditional compilation
    #if		the full boolean language of defined(), &&, ||, ==, etc.
    #elif	chained conditionals
    #define	in-line definitions (both symbols and macros)
    #undef	in-line revocation of definitions
    #include	file inclusion
    #line	line number directives
    \\n		line continuations within all # directives
    ##  /**/	token catenation within a macro definition

Macro expansion is recursive.  Redefinition of a macro or symbol does
not generate a warning.  Macros can be defined on the command-line
with -D just like symbols.  Macro/symbol names are permitted to be
Haskell identifiers e.g. with the ' character, which is slightly
looser than in C, but they still may not include operators.

Numbering of lines in the output is preserved so that any later
processor can give meaningful error messages.  When a file is
#include'd, cpphs inserts #line directives for the same reason.
Numbering should be correct even in the presence of line continuations.
If you don't want #line directives in the final output, use the
--noline option.

Any syntax errors in cpp directives, and any failure to find a
#include'd file, gives a message to standard error and halts the
rogram.
