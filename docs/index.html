<center><h3><a name="what">What is cpphs?</a></h3></center>
<p>
<b>cpphs</b> is a simplified implementation of cpp,
the C pre-processor, in Haskell.

<p>
This cut-down version of the C pre-processor is incomplete.
For now, it only operates on lines beginning with a #.  No
attempt is made to expand symbols or parametrised macros
within lines (except as required to resolve #if's).

<p>
Features that do work:
<dl>
<dt>#ifdef</dt>	 <dd>simple conditional compilation</dd>
<dt>#if</dt>	 <dd>the full boolean language of defined(),
                     &amp;&amp;, ||, ==, etc.</dd>
<dt>#elif</dt>	 <dd>chained conditionals</dd>
<dt>#define</dt> <dd>in-line definitions (symbols only, not macros)</dd>
<dt>#undef</dt>	 <dd>in-line revocation of definitions</dd>
<dt>#include</dt><dd>file inclusion</dd>
<dt>#line</dt>   <dd>line number directives</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Numbering of lines in the output is preserved so that any later
processor can give meaningful error messages.  When a file is
#include'd, cpphs inserts #line directives for the same reason.

<p>
Any syntax errors in cpp directives, and any failure to find a
#include'd file, gives a message to standard error and halts the
program.

<p>
Features that don't work:
<dl>
<dt>#define</dt> <dd>parametrised macro definitions</dd>
<dt>\</dt>	 <dd>especially those that extend over several lines
		     with line continuation characters</dd>
</dl>

<center><h3><a name="how">How do I use it?</a></h3></center>
<p>
<center><pre>
Usage: cpphs  [ filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath ]+
</pre></center>
<p>
You can give any number of filenames on the command-line.  The
results are catenated on standard output.

<p>
Options:
<dl>
<dt>-Dsym</dt>    <dd>define a symbol</dd>
<dt>-Dsym=val</dt><dd>define a symbol with a specific value</dd>
<dt>-Ipath</dt>   <dd>add a directory to the search path for #include's</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are NO symbols defined by default.  Could easily be changed in
the source code though.  The search path is searched in order of the -I
options, except that the current directory is always searched first.
Again, there is no default search path (and again, could easily
be changed).

<p>
I am interested in hearing your feedback on cpphs.  Bug reports
especially welcome, since it is so new.  You can send Feature requests
too, but I won't guarantee to attend to them, especially if they
depart from ordinary cpp's behaviour.  Please mail

The application module 'cpphs.hs' itself is trivial (since all
the functionality is inside the library) and so is placed into the
